# Seat-Booking-AntD
The Covid pandemic has changed the way we do some things nowadays mainly because of the strict health and safety measures that we must observe. For instance, 
many public functions that involve people being seated, especially Churches, have now turned to technology to enable people to book their seats online before 
attending the function.

An IT company (your group) has decided to develop a web app in which Churches and any other public gatherings can use to enable those who are to attend the function to book their seats.

This particular seat booking web app should be able to do the following:

- Allow the organizers of a public function to register their public function;

- Allow any member of the public to book a seat for their public function of interest.

- Allow the organizers of a public function to see how many seats have been booked and how many have not.

- Allow the organizers of a public function to see the names of those who have made seat bookings.




# Project Scope
Ideally, such a project would require a login for the organizers of a public function. However, for this project, no login functionality is required as it is assumed that the login functionality would be added in a different phase of the project. Therefore, when testing/demonstrating the web app, any user will be able to access all parts of the web app.

# Project Requirements
- The front-end of the web application MUST be developed using React.

- The back-end of the web application can be developed using any technologies of your choice, however, it would be much easier using Node and Express on the back-end as we did in the “Template Project”;

- The front-end and back-end MUST communicate using RESTful web services;

- The front-end and back-end should be packaged separately, and only the front-end (React app) should be submitted on Blackboard by the 1st of December 2021;

- Each group MUST present their project to the class on the 2nd of December 2021.
